              <p>A very popular trick for solving certain types of optimization problems is this: write your objective as the solution of a two-player zero-sum game, endow both players with an appropriate learning algorithm, watch how the opponents compete, and extract an (approximate) solution from the actions/decisions taken by the players throughout the process. This approach is very generic and provides a natural template to produce new and interesting algorithms. I will describe this framework and show how it applies in several scenarios, and describe recent work drawing connections to classical algorithms including Frank-Wolfe, Nesterov Accelerated Gradient Descent, and many others. </p>

              <p>We present a generic acceleration recipe for smooth minimax optimization. By simply combing with existing solvers such as extra-gradient method as the workhorse for subproblems,  one can achieve best-known convergence rates for minimax optimization in various regimes such as the strongly-convex-(strongly)-concave,  nonconvex-(strongly)-concave settings.  Our key idea is largely inspired by the Catalyst framework in [Lin, Mairal, and Harchaoui, 2015] and can be framed as an inexact accelerated proximal point algorithm. The framework can be extended to solving finite-sum minimax problems and special classes of nonconvex-nonconcave minimax problems with best-known rates.</p>

              <p>Consider a two player multi-armed bandit problem, where one arm has a known success probability, while the other arm does not. In every round, each player pulls an arm, gets the reward from the arm they pulled, and observes the action of the other player but not their reward. The model is related to the economics literature on strategic experimentation, where usually players observe each other's rewards. 

We show that two competing players explore less than a single player with an optimal strategy, while cooperating players explore more. Neutral players learn from each other, receiving strictly higher rewards than if they played by themselves. Both competing and neutral players settle on the same arm in the long term.

 

I will also discuss exchange and production markets with additive valuations, when players learn to bid using proportional response dynamics. In the production market, this dynamic leads to growth of the market in the long term, but also creates growing inequality between the players. In the exchange market, the proportional response dynamic converges to market equilibria. This resolves an open question about the exchange market, where tatonnement does not converge to market equilibria and no natural process leading to equilibria was known.

This is based on joint works with Peres and Devanur, Mehta, Nisan, and Rabani.</p>

              <p>Black-box reduction from offline optimization to online algorithms has been the topic of study of numerous works (Kalai and Vempala (2005); Dud√≠k et al. (2017); Kakade et al. (2009); Hazan and Koren (2016)). In this work, we consider designing online algorithms for problems with greedy approximation algorithms which are robust to local errors. Our first result is a reduction which gives a $O(\sqrt{T})$-regret algorithm for the full information setting via Blackwell Approachability. Next, we introduce Bandit Blackwell Sequential Games which is a bandit version of Blackwell Approachability, and leverage this to get a reduction which gives a $O(T^{2/3})$-regret algorithm in the bandit setting. We further show several applications of these reductions to problems including submodular maximization, reserve pricing in auctions, and assortment optimization. </p>

              <p>Extragradient method (EG) is one of the most popular methods for solving saddle point and variational inequalities problems (VIP). Despite its long history and significant attention in the optimization community, there remain important open questions about the convergence of EG. In this paper, we resolve one of such questions and derive the first last-iterate O(1/K) convergence rate for EG for monotone and Lipschitz VIP without any additional assumptions on the operator. The rate is given in terms of reducing the squared norm of the operator. Moreover, we establish several results on the (non-)cocoercivity of the update operators of EG, Optimistic Gradient Method, and Hamiltonian Gradient Method, when the original operator is monotone and Lipschitz.   The central part of our analysis is based on Performance Estimation Problems and computer-assistant proofs. In the talk, I will pay special attention to this approach and explain the main non-trivial issues we faced on the way of getting the final proofs via numerical computations.<br><br>Papers connected with this talk:

              <p>In game theoretic learning, e.g., for matrix games and population games, agents myopically adapt their strategies in reaction to the evolving strategies of other agents in an effort to maximize their own utilities. The resulting interactions can be represented as a dynamical system that maps agent observations to agent strategies. Well-known and widely studied examples of adaptation/learning rules include fictitious play, gradient play, regret minimization, and replicator dynamics.  In these examples, the associated learning rule has an induced dimensionality, or number of states, that is equal to the number of agent actions. As the terminology suggests, ‚Äúhigher-order‚Äù learning refers to learning rules that are not restricted in their dimensionality. Such learning rules introduce auxiliary states not included in their lower-order counterparts, while respecting the original informational structure of what is observed and known to each agent. 

 

This talk presents on overview of results that illustrate how higher-order learning can induce qualitative changes in long-run outcomes, including convergence to Nash equilibria not possible under lower-order dynamics (including uncoupled dynamics counterexamples and replicator dynamics for zero-sum games). A specific focus will be on higher-order ‚Äúanticipatory‚Äù versions of lower-order learning rules, which appears to parallel optimistic versions of optimization algorithms. The talk concludes with an analysis framework for higher-order learning that exploits an implicit feedback structure in game-theoretic learning, where the learning dynamics are separated from the game specifics. In particular, the talk presents the concept of passivity from feedback control, its application to higher-order learning analysis, and connections to contractive/stable games.</p>
