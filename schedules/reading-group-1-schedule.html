              <p>The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence owing to its enormous search space and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves. In this talk I will cover AlphaGo, an approach to computer Go that uses ‘value networks’ to evaluate board positions and ‘policy networks’ to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0, and later to defeat a previous Go professional Lee Sedol. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go. Toward the end of the talk, I will give a short survey of what has happened since this landmark event in AI and some open challenges for continued work in this area.<br><br>Papers connected with this talk:

              <p>While modern machine learning systems can succeed on challenging benchmarks, they are quite brittle: their performance significantly degrades when exposed to even small variations of their training environments.
How can we build ML models that are more robust? In this talk, I will present a framework for reasoning about the worst-case behavior of our machine learning systems. I will then describe how this framework can be used in practice to train models that are invariant to a broad family of worst-case input perturbations. Finally, I will discuss how such robust learning can be fundamentally different from standard learning, presenting a unique set of challenges and opportunities.<br><br>Papers connected with this talk:

              <p>We consider regret minimization in repeated games with non-convex loss functions. Minimizing the standard notion of regret is computationally intractable. Thus, we define a natural notion of regret which permits efficient optimization and generalizes offline guarantees for convergence to an approximate local optimum. We give gradient-based methods that achieve optimal regret, which in turn guarantee convergence to equilibrium in this framework.<br><br>Papers connected with this talk:

              <p>On-line firms deploy suites of software platforms, where each platform is designed to interact with users during a certain activity, such as browsing, chatting, socializing, emailing, driving, etc. The economic and incentive structure of this exchange, as well as its algorithmic nature, have not been explored to our knowledge. We model this interaction as a Stackelberg game between a Designer and one or more Agents. We model an Agent as a Markov chain whose states are activities; we assume that the Agent's utility is a linear function of the steady-state distribution of this chain. The Designer may design a platform for each of these activities/states; if a platform is adopted by the Agent, the transition probabilities of the Markov chain are affected, and so is the objective of the Agent. The Designer's utility is a linear function of the steady state probabilities of the accessible states minus the development cost of the platforms. The underlying optimization problem of the Agent -- how to choose the states for which to adopt the platform -- is an MDP. If this MDP has a simple yet plausible structure (the transition probabilities from one state to another only depend on the target state and the recurrent probability of the current state) the Agent's problem can be solved by a greedy algorithm. The Designer's optimization problem (designing a custom suite for the Agent so as to optimize, through the Agent's optimum reaction, the Designer's revenue), is NP-hard to approximate within any finite ratio; however, the special case, while still NP-hard, has an FPTAS. These results generalize from a single Agent to a distribution of Agents with finite support, as well as to the setting where the Designer must find the best response to the existing strategies of other Designers. We discuss other implications of our results and directions of future research. </p>

Compared to minimization, the min-max optimization in machine learning applications is considerably more convoluted because of the existence of cycles and similar phenomena. Such oscillatory behaviors are well-understood in the convex-concave regime, and many algorithms are known to overcome them. In this paper, we go beyond this basic setting and characterize the convergence properties of many popular methods in solving non-convex/non-concave problems. In particular, we show that a wide class of state-of-the-art schemes and heuristics may converge with arbitrarily high probability to attractors that are in no way min-max optimal or even stationary. Our work thus points out a potential pitfall among many existing theoretical frameworks, and we corroborate our theoretical claims by explicitly showcasing spurious attractors in simple two-dimensional problems.

Several widely-used first-order saddle point optimization methods yield an identical continuous-time ordinary differential equation (ODE) to that of the Gradient Descent Ascent (GDA) method when derived naively. However, their convergence properties are very different even on simple bilinear games. We use a technique from fluid dynamics called High-Resolution Differential Equations (HRDEs) to design ODEs of several saddle point optimization methods. For bilinear games, the convergence properties of the derived HRDEs correspond to that of the starting discrete methods. Using these techniques, we show that the HRDE of Optimistic Gradient Descent Ascent (OGDA) has last-iterate convergence for general monotone variational inequalities. To our knowledge, this is the first proof in continuous-time for monotone variational inequalities. Moreover, we provide the rates for the best-iterate convergence of the OGDA method, relying solely on the first-order smoothness of the monotone operator.
